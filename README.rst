canon-remote_ - what an unimaginative name
==========================================

About
-----

`canon-remote`_ is a USB interface for Canon digital cameras in Python. It
originally started as a python port of `gphoto2`_'s `Canon library`_ for a
PowerShot G3. Only the subset necessary for this model was ported, but it
should be usable with other models from that era (not without hacking). The project
was created because gphoto2 lacks support for certain remote capture
features, namely locking the autofocus and setting the autofocus mode
to macro.

The latest project documentation can be found at the `project homepage`_.

`The code`_ is hosted `bitbucket`_.
